# Analysis
Here are various Python Notebooks used to generate figures and analysis in the main paper.

## Relevant Analysis Notebooks
1. [`basic_saccade_analysis.py`](basic_saccade_analysis.py): Analysis that does not involve looking at neural activity.
2. [`analyze_cell_responses.py`](analyze_cell_responses.py): Analysis that focuses on neural activity and saccade-responsive neurons.
3. [`saccade_responses_by_stim.py`](saccade_responses_by_stim.py): Looks at saccade responses within different stimuli.
4. [`sample_neural_activity.py`](sample_neural_activity.py): Plot out example saccade neural responses.

## Helper Files
- [`analysis_helpers.py`](analysis_helpers.py): Helper functions for analysis notebooks.
- [`eye_plotting.py`](eye_plotting.py): Helper functions for plotting.
